			<p>Mandarinfish are peaceful by temperament. During daytime, the mandarinfish are quite reclusive by nature, however, at times, they can be seen perching or hopping atop corals. They move by briskly pulsating their fins, which reminds of a hummingbird. Being shy by nature, they hide themselves under corals or in sand bed when threatened, or at night. They tend to avoid any kind if bright light.</p>
