You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

  * So far its been great! I had a background in html, however the lessons were really structured and I learnt about what was wrong and right approach in html5.
  I used to blindly use <br> tag for instance , but now I have learnt good coding techniques.
  * so far everything is great. :)
  * Gonna wait for the tough bits yet ;)
  * Research was the best bit , so if I didnt know a tag i just searched it. that was very useful.
